# PYTHON

# INTRODUCTION

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

# Creating a Comment

Comments starts with a `#`, and Python will ignore them:

```python

#This is a commentprint("Hello, World!")
```

# Creating Variables

Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

```python
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
```

# Variable Names

A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:

- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
- A variable name cannot be any of the [Python keywords](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp).

# Legal variable names:

```python
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"
```

# code

```python
first_name = 'hanna'
age = 32
height = 11.8
print(type(first_name))

print(type(age))

print(type(height))

```

# List

Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are [Tuple](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp), [Set](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp), and [Dictionary](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp), all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are created using square brackets

```python
#list
students_list = ['hanna', 'john', 'besh']
students_list.insert(3,"hailu")
print(students_list[1])

```

# Tuple

Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are [List](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp), [Set](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_sets.asp), and [Dictionary](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp), all with different qualities and usage.

A tuple is a collection which is ordered and **unchangeable**.

Tuples are written with round brackets.

```python
#tuple
names = {'hanna' , 'kebede', 'yakob','maki'}
print(type(names))

```

# Set

Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are [List](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp), [Tuple](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp), and [Dictionary](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp), all with different qualities and usage.

A set is a collection which is *unordered*, *unchangeable**, and *unindexed*.

- **Note:** Set *items* are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.

```python
#set
# set cannot hold any duplicated list
names = {'hanna' , 'kebede', 'yakob','maki','maki'}
print(names)
```

# set cannot hold any duplicated list

```python
names = {'hanna' , 'kebede', 'yakob','maki','maki'}
print(names)student_info={'name':'hanna',
'age':12,
'sec':'B',
'height':1.3,
'skills':['java','javascript','python','django','mongo']
}print(student_info)print(student_info['height'])#loop

```

```python
#for loop
for i in range(0,12):
print(i)
print('hello')for index, value in enumerate (students_list):
    print(value)

```

In Python, control flow statements are used to control the execution flow of a program. These statements allow you to make decisions, loop through code, and handle exceptions. The main control flow statements in Python include:

1. **if statement:**
The `if` statement is used for conditional branching. It allows you to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is true.
    
    ```python
    if condition:
        # code to be executed if the condition is true
    
    ```
    
2. **else statement:**
The `else` statement is used in conjunction with an `if` statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition in the `if` statement is false.
    
    ```python
    if condition:
        # code to be executed if the condition is true
    else:
        # code to be executed if the condition is false
    
    ```
    
3. **elif statement:**
The `elif` statement (short for "else if") is used to check multiple conditions in a sequential manner.
    
    ```python
    if condition1:
        # code to be executed if condition1 is true
    elif condition2:
        # code to be executed if condition2 is true
    else:
        # code to be executed if none of the conditions are true
    
    ```
    
4. **for loop:**
The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.
    
    ```python
    for item in sequence:
        # code to be executed for each item in the sequence
    
    ```
    
5. **while loop:**
The `while` loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.
    
    ```python
    while condition:
        # code to be executed as long as the condition is true
    
    ```
    
6. **break statement:**
The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, before the loop condition becomes false.
    
    ```python
    for item in sequence:
        if condition:
            # code to be executed when the condition is true
            break
    
    ```
    
7. **continue statement:**
The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration and move to the next iteration.
    
    ```python
    for item in sequence:
        if condition:
            # skip the rest of the code and move to the next iteration
            continue
        # code to be executed for each iteration, excluding the skipped one
    
    ```
    

# Function

```python
def greet():
    print('hll world')

    def greet_with_nam(name):
        print(f'hello': {name})
greet()
        greet_with_name('hanna', age =56)
```
